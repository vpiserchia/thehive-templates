These tools bridge the gap between vulnerability management and patch management by providing continuous visibility into remediation progress and validating that security gaps are truly closed. When properly implemented, these systems create accountability, tangible visibility via dynamic KPIs and ensure no vulnerabilities remain unaddressed after initial remediation\nattempts.\n\nSimilarly, enterprise-wide remediation dashboards provide security teams and leadership with real-time visibility into remediation status, timelines, and effectiveness. These platforms\nconsolidate data from various security tools to present a unified view of remediation progress against established SLAs and risk thresholds.","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":3},{"id":"~123232480","_id":"~123232480","createdBy":"admin@lab.local","createdAt":1748897008436,"_type":"case_task","title":"Detect","group":"Identification","description":"**Vulnerability Scanning**\n- Use automated tools to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.\n\n**CTI Collection**\n- Gather intelligence from various CTI sources, including open-source intelligence, commercial feeds, and information sharing and analysis centres, such as ISACs.\n\n**Threat Actor Profiling**\n- Identify potential threat actors relevant to the organization’s industry and technology stack.\n\n**Vulnerability Scoring**\n- Evaluate the severity of identified vulnerabilities using standards like CVSS, EPSS, etc.\n\n**CTI Integration**\n- Correlate vulnerabilities with CTI to understand if they are being actively exploited or targeted by threat actors.\n\n**Environmental Analysis**\n- Assess the relevance of each vulnerability in the context of the organization’s own environmental reality and realistic threat landscape.\n\n**Prioritization**\n- Determine the potential impact and likelihood of exploitation for each vulnerability.\n- Apply CTI-derived scores to vulnerabilities based on factors like exploit availability, threat actor activity, and industry targeting.\n- Create logic-based or scoring-based workflows to categorize vulnerabilities into priority levels (e.g. very high, high, medium, low) based on combined risk and CTI scores.\n- Encompass the factor of business criticality and the potential impact on operations and production when prioritizing vulnerabilities for your organization.\n\n**Prioritization Standards & Tools**\n\n- CVSS focuses on the severity of vulnerabilities based on their technical characteristics but lacks real-world exploitability data.\n\n- EPSS predicts the likelihood of exploitation, providing a more dynamic and actionable approach to prioritization.\n\n- Vulnerability Risk Management tools often combine CVSS and EPSS scores with additional organizational or environmental context, such as asset criticality or business impact.\n\nVendors & Organizations often develop their own Proprietary Scoring Models & Systems tailored to their specific risk tolerance and operational needs.","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":1},{"id":"~123236576","_id":"~123236576","createdBy":"admin@lab.local","createdAt":1748897008440,"_type":"case_task","title":"Mitigate the Attack","group":"Containment","description":"- Develop action plans to address high-priority vulnerabilities first, leveraging patch management, configuration changes, or other mitigation strategies.\n- Assign time-sensitive deadlines and service level agreements corresponding to the varying levels of vulnerability severity.\n- Allocate resources effectively to ensure timely remediation of critical vulnerabilities.\n- Inform relevant stakeholders about prioritized vulnerabilities and remediation plans.\n\n\nA **Service Level Agreement** or SLA in Vulnerability Management is a **formalized agreement that defines the expectations, timelines, and responsibilities for addressing security vulnerabilities. It is essential for ensuring that vulnerabilities are remediated in a timely and efficient manner**, reducing the risk of exploitation and aligning with organizational security goals.\n\n\n**SLAs establish specific deadlines for fixing vulnerabilities based on their severity**. For example, critical vulnerabilities might need to be addressed within 24 hours to 72 hours, while\nlower-risk issues could have longer timeframes. These timelines ensure that the most severe risks are prioritized and mitigated quickly.\n\n\n**SLAs are tailored to the organization's risk appetite and the potential impact of vulnerabilities**.

TH may be seen as a critical verification layer that ensures environments remain secure after remediation actions. **TH employs advanced detection techniques including behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, and\npattern recognition to identify potential compromise indicators** that standard vulnerability scanners might miss. For example, while a critical RCE vulnerability may be patched, threat hunting can reveal whether it was exploited prior to remediation by examining system logs, network traffic patterns, and file\nintegrity changes.\n\n**Attack Surface Management or ASM process provides continuous visibility into an organization's external and internal attack surfaces**, helping security teams understand the context and potential impact of vulnerabilities across the enterprise. **ASM complements traditional vulnerability management\nby offering real-time insights into exposure levels even after remediation efforts. ASM services continuously discover and inventory assets, monitor for changes to the attack surface, and provide prioritization capabilities based on business context and threat intelligence**. For instance, after remediating a critical vulnerability in a public-facing application, ASM can verify that the fix is correctly deployed across all instances and alert to any new deployments that might reintroduce the vulnerability.","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":4},{"id":"~205144064","_id":"~205144064","createdBy":"admin@lab.local","createdAt":1748897008435,"_type":"case_task","title":"Preparation","group":"Preparation","description":"- Develop or acquire vulnerability and exploit-related CTI sources such as threat feeds, intelligence reports, access to dedicated repositories and databases.\n- Set up internal vulnerability monitoring & CTI tools and platforms for data aggregation and analysis.\n- Assign responsibilities for CTI collection, analysis, and integration into vulnerability management.\n- Create guidelines for vulnerability assessment and prioritization using CTI.\n- Develop a comprehensive inventory of all systems and software versions within the organization to understand the potential attack surface.\n- Establish a threat intelligence program to continuously gather and analyze data on emerging threats and vulnerabilities.\n- Prepare communication channels and templates for rapid dissemination of information needed for Vulnerability Management purposes used during a vulnerability-related incident.\n- Train the incident response team and other involved teams on the use of threat intelligence and vulnerability monitoring tools, services, and methodologies.\n- Establish operational channels for efficient information sharing between involved teams.\n\n**Business Awareness for Proactive Vulnerability Management**\n\nProactively managing vulnerabilities is crucial for safeguarding your business' information systems.

Valuable knowledge often becomes trapped in isolated environments, preventing true organizational learning and leading to repeated security mistakes. Effective knowledge management transforms individual experiences into institutional wisdom by systematically capturing remediation approaches, mitigation strategies, and decision-making processes that worked—or didn't work—during security incidents.\n\nSystematic collection and analysis of lessons learned during vulnerability remediation creates a feedback loop that continuously strengthens an organization's security posture. By documenting near misses, successful mitigations, and remediation challenges, security teams build an institutional memory that becomes increasingly valuable over time. This knowledge repository allows organizations to highlight averted security incidents thus quantifying the \"non-events\" that represent successful security interventions, which helps demonstrate the value of security investments and proactive remediation efforts to leadership.","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":5}],"status":"Ok","customFields":{},"metrics":{}}
